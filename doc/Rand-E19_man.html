<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>e</I>

invokes the Rand editor.
The Rand editor is a full screen text editor with file editing in
windows on the screen.
Editing is done by typing directly into the window, and functions
include &quot;cut&quot; and &quot;paste&quot; operations,
simple formatting, and embedding UNIX command output in the
file.
<P>

The parameter
<I>file</I>

denotes the file to be edited and
<I>altfile</I>

is an optional alternate file.
With no file names given the editor will resume the latest
editing session in the directory, if any,
otherwise it will prompt for a file name.
<P>

<I>E</I>

is a complete rewrite of the Rand editor
<I>NED</I>

The current version (E19) takes
advantage of terminals that have the ability to
do local insert/delete line.
A reference manual
<I>The Rand Editor, E, April 1984</I>

is available on the PRIAM VAX using the
notesfile scheme and the printdoc command.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The currently available command line options are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-help</B>

<DD>
<BR>

This causes a display of the currently available
options and their values along with the version number
of the editor.
<BR>

Use this option to list the updated list of options.
<DT><B>-bullets</B> or <B>-nobullets</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Options -bullets and -nobullets forces border bullets on or off
regardless of line speed or terminal type.  Line speeds of 1200
baud and slower and some terminal types set border bullets off in
the absence of these options.
<DT><B>-inplace</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -inplace preserves file links except for singly-linked
files.  From within the editor, link preservation can be
turned on and off, even for singly-linked files, by the update
command.
<DT><B>-terminal=termtype</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -terminal=termtype identifies the terminal type explicitly.
In the absence of the -terminal option the terminal type is retrieved
from the
<FONT SIZE="-1">TERM</FONT>
environment variable.
<DT><B>-keyboard=termtype or -dkeyboard=termtype</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -keyboard=termtype sets the keyboard type to &quot;termtype&quot;.  It
overrides any &quot;-terminal=&quot; argument and also any
<FONT SIZE="-1">EKBD</FONT>
environment variable.
<DT><B>-dtermcap</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -dtermcap forces
<I>E</I>

to use the termcap entry for the terminal
identified by the
<FONT SIZE="-1">TERM</FONT>
variable or -terminal option, disregarding
any applicable compiled-in code.
<DT><B>-notracks</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -notracks will allow you to edit a file without using or
disturbing the work files (keys, state, and change files) from your
previous session.
<DT><B>-package=directory_name</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -package=directory_name allows you to overwrite the build in
default directory in which the Rand editor is looking to find
service programs (like just, fill) and messages and information
files (like Crashdoc, helpkey).
In the absence of the -package option the Rand package directory is
retrieved from the
<FONT SIZE="-1">RAND_PACKG</FONT>
environment variable.
<DT><B>-replay=filename</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -replay=filename allows you to replay with a specified keys
file, where &quot;filename&quot; represents that keys file.  Use -silent when
the replay display is not desired.  The message &quot;***replay
completed&quot; or &quot;***replay aborted&quot; signals the end of the replay.
The
<FONT SIZE="-1">&lt;INT&gt;</FONT>
key can be used to stop the replay short of completion.
Files .ec1* and .ek1* must not be present if the replay is to
work.
<DT><B>-norecover</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -norecover will open the edit session as defined by the .es1
state file, ignoring any recovery processing of a prior crashed or
aborted session.
<DT><B>-regexp</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -regexp enables regular expression
pattern matching for searching
and replacing.  This mode is also enabled by the &quot;re[gexp]&quot; command.
In regular expression mode, &quot;RE&quot;
is displayed at the bottom of the screen.  The command &quot;-re[gexp]&quot;
returns to non-regular expression mode.
The regular expressions recognized are
essentially the same as that for <I>ed</I>.
<DT><B>-state=filename</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -state=filename causes the initial state of the editor to be
read from the indicated &quot;state&quot; file.  The state file from a previous
<I>E</I> session (with alternate files, windows, cursor positioning,
etc.) may be saved by exiting, and renaming the state file (&quot;.es1&quot;).
<DT><B>-dump_state_file</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -dump_state_file display in a readable format the content of the
&quot;state&quot; file. This state file can be explicitely define by the
&quot;-state=filename&quot; option or is the state file which will be used
when the editor is called without file name parameter.
<DT><B>-[no]stick</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -stick sets the behavior at the right margin to stop in response
to typing or a &lt;RT ARROW&gt;.  -nostick is the default, and will automatically
shift the window right in response to text or &lt;RT ARROW&gt; key.
<DT><B>-nox11</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -nox11 disables calls to X11 library during startup to get the keyboard
mapping.
<DT><B>-debug=[debug output file name]:[debug level]</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -debug starts a debugging session, level = 0 : debugging suspended,
level != 0 : debugging actif. Use the command 'set debuglevel x' to
suspend, resume the debugging. When the debugging is suspended, the
debugging output file is flused, and closed. When debugging is resumed,
entering in a level != 0, the debugging output file is reopened for append.
On starting the debugging session, the sizeof the major Rand data type
(like Char, Flag, ...) is dumped on the debugging file.
<DT><B>-version</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Option -version display editor version informations. It is equivalent to
the -help option.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>TERMINAL TYPES</H2>

The terminal type is defined by the option -terminal if given,
otherwise by the TERM environment variable.
<P>

The mapping of the logical keys onto physical terminal keys
is also defined by the terminal type,
unless the EKBD environment variable is set to
standard or the option -keyboard=standard is given.
This option overrides the EKBD variable, if any.
<P>

The instructions to drive the terminal may be coded in the editor
or may be stored in the <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+termcap">termcap</A>(5) database.
The parameter -dtermcap forces the use of <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+termcap">termcap</A>(5).
<P>

The following terminal types are recognised:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Pericom                   - pa
<BR>

Pericom with 132 columns  - pa132

<P>

<I>Terminal tables</I>
<P>


The following tables show function key assignments on the
different terminals.
<BR>

<P>
<I>The Newbury 7001 terminal:</I>

<P>

The terminal type must be set to
<I>nb7</I>

and ned needs a keyboard file which is used
to map the newbury &quot;function&quot; keys.
This keyboard file is preferably set in the environment variable
EKBFILE, currently the file is called
<I>/etc/e/kbfiles/newbkb.</I>

<P>

Before the Newbury can be used it must be set up locally by the user.
He must check the terminal status page.
This is done by putting the terminal in EDIT mode, press the EDIT key.
Then press the CONTROL and HOME keys at the same time.
<P>

The terminal must be set up with the following options:
<BR>

In the top status line: ... DELETE=Y;NL=NO...
<BR>

In the status page:
<P>

<BR>

- All control characters allowed, no characters are underlined.
<BR>

- clear from home
<BR>

- clear on reset : yes
<BR>

- cursor skip : yes
<BR>

- attributes: protect = no, blink=no, underline=yes.
<PRE>

Using the above mentioned keyboard file, the ned editor works as
the following control keys table shows:


+------------------------------+-------------------------+

<I>The TANDBERG 2200 terminal:</I>

<P>

The terminal type must be set to
<I>tdv</I>

and ned needs a keyboard file which is used
to map the TANDBERG &quot;function&quot; keys.
This keyboard file is preferably set in the environment variable
EKBFILE, currently the file is called
<I>/etc/e/kbfiles/tdvkb.</I>

The assignments of the keys to editor functions as defined in the
keyboard file for the TANDBERG terminal is shown in the following table:

<I>Rand editor standard keyboard</I>

<P>

The keyboard layout below is designed for
terminals with no function keys.
&quot;^H&quot; means control-H, and &quot;^X-^U&quot; means control-X
followed by control-U.  The ALT entry gives you a choice of `^/' or
`^_' because one or the other or both will not work on some terminals.
Note that JOIN, SPLIT, and ERASE are now available as function keys.

<P>

All of these commands take the named buffer (one of
adjust, close, erase, pick, run, or box) and add or
merge it into the current file.
<P>

Insert takes the named buffer, moves the existing text
to make room for it, and then inserts it at the
current text location.  It is identical to the -pick
command, except that now the other named buffers can
also be inserted.
<P>

Cover places the named buffer over top of the text without
moving anything.
<P>

Overlay is like cover, except that only the printing
characters in the buffer clobber the original text.
<P>

Underlay is the reverse of overlay, i.e. the buffer covers
only the non-printing characters of the original text.
<P>

Blot is like overlay except that positions in the file
corresponding to printing characters in the buffer are erased.
<P>

-blot is like blot except that positions in the file
corresponding to blanks in the buffer are erased.

<H2><DT>\,filename - comma file.<DD>
</H2>

<P>
The file being edited is left
unchanged until a normal exit is made from the editor.
The file is then copied onto a file with the same name
preceded by a , (comma) and thereafter
the modifications are applied.
If no modifications are made or at abnormal exits
(exit with a paramater) the comma file is not produced.
<BR>

For a file to be changed, it and its directory
must both have write permission.
<DT>\.ec1      - change file.<DD>
All changed text from the file being edited is collected in
the change file.
The changed text may be accessed as alternate files
via the pseudo file names #o and #p,
and text may be picked from them.
<BR>

The #o (old lines) file contains all original versions
of changed lines.
<BR>

The #p (pick) file contains all picked text.
Text picked from the #p file is not appended to it.
<DT>\.ek1 .ek1b  - keystroke files.<DD>
The files contain all changes made to the files being edited.
The format is such that the changes can be applied when a normal
exit is made from the editor.
<BR>

If an exit is made with parameter dump, or if the editor
crashes, the keystroke files can be used for recovering
the lost editing session.
Recovery is done by invoking the editor without a filename,
it will then present recovery options to the user.
The file .ek1b is used in the recovery process.
<DT>\.es1      - state file.<DD>
The state file contains information about the last file edited in the
directory, including file name, the place in the file where the cursor
were when the editor was terminated, the width value (center, fill, justify),
the state (insert or normal), the tabulators and the last search string.
<BR>

When the editor is called without a file name the state file is used
to recreate the situation that existed at the previous termination.
