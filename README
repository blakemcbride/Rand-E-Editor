Version 19.58 by Fabien Perriollat CERN/PS <Fabien.Perriollat@cern.ch>
This version provide some support for 8 bit characaters (ISO 8859
character set). The key function "cchar" (quoted character) can be used
to enter any char by its code value.
IMPORTANT NOTICE : this version is not backward compatible with the
previous one for the key stroke file content (used in replay facility).
New help commands to display the character sets used to display text
and window edges.
New directives for keyboard definition files and an editor command
"build-kbfile" to generate a definition file from the current setting.
The help <keyword> provide on line help for editor command or keyboard
function, or both. New directives "#!Comment" and "#!-Comment" for long
comment in the keyboard definition file.
Help key start to be context sensitive. New "help" directives : <keyword>,
provide info on te given command or key function, "charset" and "graphset"
display the characters set in used for the editing window and for the
window edges. The "set" command can be used to switch from the default
window edges character set to the alternated one (normaly the grphic one).
In file or command (or parameter) expansion a second "tab" key stroke
display the list of entries which match the partern.
In the command window a single "!" character after a command name display
some info about the parameters list for this command.
New directive "#!Comment" and "#!-Comment" for keyboard definition file.
Look at the file generated by "build-kbfile" for the available set of
keywords and directives.
New option for "set" command : "set info n" define what to display on
the information line.
Modification of the spec file to be able to build the package from
a user defined root directory. The .rpmmacros file is provide, and
can be copied into $HOME/ to simplify package building.
A POSIX lock file is used on the key stroke working file to allow muiltiple
sessions by the same user in the same directory, (see the session number
in the working files .es1, .ec1 .ek1 .ek1b for sessions '1' ... '9').
Various bugs and inconsistancy in startup corrected, handling exit
of a -notracks session changed : the new state file (.esX) is saved.
New aliases for the 'exit' command : 'quit', 'q'
The empty option parameter '-' can be used to end the option list
and edit a file for which the name start with a '-' character.
Cursor current and previous positions, and file tick mark are save into
status file, and restaured.
Transient tick mark is generated on major window motions (look at the
'help keyf tick' output for descrition of transiant tick and key tick
navigation facility.
The command "edit -" can be used to remove a file from the current list
of edited file (if it is not modified, nor referenced).
New syntax for the -debug option : -debug=[debug output file]:[debug level]
The "set debuglevel 0" suspend the debugging printout, and close the
output file. "set debuglevel <no zero level>" resume the debugging.
The new "set preferences" command save the user preferenes into preferences
file : $HOME/.Rand/preferences (see on line help for set command).
"set preferences ?"  Display the content of preferences file for the
current terminal.

Version 19.57 by Fabien Perriollat CERN/PS <Fabien.Perriollat@cern.ch>
This version is mandatory for a corrrect handling of very large file
system.
  Very large file systems are supported with the _FILE_OFFSET_BITS conditional
    compilation flag. This provides a correct navigation capability on very
    large file systems.
  Look at the output of the command "help new" for the other new features of
    this release.
  A small shell script "my_e" provide the correct mapping of F1 - F4 and
    PF1 - PF4 xterm keys without disturbance for other applications.

Version 19.56 by Fabien Perriollat CERN/PS <Fabien.Perriollat@cern.ch>

This version of the rand editor currently compiles on the
following architectures:

- Linux  2.*, (ReadHat 6.* distribution) for i386 familly
- AIX    4.x
- Solaris (Sun OS 5.*) on sun hardware
- LynxOS (RT kernel), Posix complient, version 3.* for PowerPC

As it is there, it does look any more for special files in /ps/local/$OS/e
where $OS = AIX, ULTRIX or OSF1 (as reported by uname)

Local dependencies are defined by the dynamicaly generated file 'e19/e.r.c"
by the 'e19/NewVersion' shell script. This script take is parameters
from the calling Makefile.

The 'NewVersion'shell script need the 'bash' shell program.
To update this script on a given target computer according to the
local environment use 'make local' in the top level package directory.

Installation and configuration :
================================

The new version for Linux and AIX use a new way to found the keyboard
configuration.

    - The full path name of the keyboard file is defined by
      (in priority order)
	1 - the value of "-kbfile" calling parameter (see --help output)
	2 - the value of "EKBFILE" environment variable
	3 - the "<package configuration>/kbfiles/<terminal type file name>"
	    the "terminal type keyboard configuration file name"

    - The "terminal type file name" configuration is defined
	1 - the name of the terminal defined by
		i  - the value of "-terminal" calling parameter (see --help output)
		ii - the value of "TERM" environment variable
	    concanetated with the postfix "kb",
	    ex : linuxkb for the default linux console
	2 - "universalkb" if the specific file does not exist
	    or cannot be read.

    - The "package configuration directory" is defined by
	1 - the user configuration directory : ".Rand" in the
	    user $HOME directory, ex : <toto home>/.Rand
	2 - the local system configuration directory : "Rand"
	    in the /usr/local/etc , ex : /usr/local/etc/Rand
	3 - the global system configuration directory : "Rand"
	    in the /etc , ex : /etc/Rand
	4 - the package directory itself.

    - The package directory is defined by :
	1 - the value of "-package" calling parameter (see --help output)
	2 - the value of "RAND_PACKG" environment variable
	3 - the directory of the Rand editor executable file.

    The output of --help option could be used to see where the editor
    expects to found the configuration files, and the name of these files.

To do a local customization of the keyboard definition,
-------------------------------------------------------
    for the system : copy the /usr/local/Rand/kbfiles directory into
	/usr/local/etc/Rand or /etc/Rand directory
    for a defined user : copy the /usr/local/Rand/kbfiles directory into
	$HOME/.Rand directory
    The content of /usr/local/Rand/kbfiles must not be edited, these files
	could be modified during installation of a new release.

  New feature for customization of the keyboard definition (version >= E19.52)
    Keyboard configuration files can use '#include <file name>' directive
      to import common definition, and latter overwrite some of the 'included'
      definition by specific one. If the 'file name' does not start with
      a '/' character, the file name path is relative to the current
      including file, else it is an absolute file name path.

Installation specific case :
============================
  The linux installation is done normally with the RPM package manager :

    The package can be relocated into a user define directory instead of
	/usr/local default installation directory
    with the "--prefix <install directory>"
    or "--relocate /usr/local=<install directory>"
    parameter of the rpm call


  Installation on system which does not provide rpm package management facility.
    The installation is done with the "make preinstall" and "make install"
    (using gmake program).
    It can be necessary to edit the Makefile file (in the Rand source root
    directory) to reflect the local file system structure.


Note for Rand Editor developpers :
==================================

  Before using Makfile to compile the rand editor, it is mandatory to
  run the local.sh (Born) shell script. This script update the other
  script which are using the bash shell with the local full path name
  of the bash shell. It allow also to modifie the local name of the Rand
  editor (see output of "./local.sh --help").

  The shell script new_release.sh (which use bask shell) is provide
  to generate updated version of files for a new revision of
  the rand Editor version E19.
  It update the RPM specification file, the top level Makefile and
  the e19/NewVersion shell script.
  This new_release.sh script can be used also to do a simple consistency
  check of revsion number between these 3 files.

  The GNU make is needed to run the Makefiles of the distribution.
    The if facility of GNU make is used to define somme flags for
    the various OS targets.
  The GNU tar and install programs are used by the Makefile, some specific
    features of these gnu pacakages are used to produce the compressed tar
    file and to install the Rand editor package.

  NOX11 and NOXKB conditional compilation flags can be used to exclude
    X11 library or X11 Keyboard extension during compilation, loading.
