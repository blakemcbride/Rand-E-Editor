This repository contains the Rand E Editor release 19.58

I modified the source to build on a modern Linux box.
(I used 64 bit LinuxMint 17.1)

It is located at:  https://github.com/blakemcbride/Rand-E-Editor

I had to install the following packages to allow it to build:
	
	libxt-dev
	libxkbfile-dev

To build and install, I did:

	make
	sudo make install

After installation, you can run it with:

	e  FILE
	
Sort of like VI, it has two modes: text edit and command

^a		switch to command mode
^a exit		exit the editor

Documentation is in the 'doc' directory.

TODO:

Right now, backspace and Del both delete character.  ^h functions as you'd
expect a backspace key to function.  Make the backspace key function as ^h.
This should be very easy.  I just haven't figured out how to map the keyboard.
