# .rpmmacros to build in the user home space
# Fabien Perriollat, CERN, Jan 2002

# ref : rpm documentation in /usr/share/doc/rpm-4.0.2
#     special attention to "macros" and "buildroot" doc files.
#   use 'rpm --eval %{macro name}' too check the definition macro values.

# it is assumed the following tree structure (for the Rand package)
#   <buildroot> ... (where the package is installed)
#   <userdir> -- src -- redhat |-- BUILD
#                              |-- RPMS
#                              |-- SOURSES (sources .tgz file)
#                              |-- SPECS   (spec .spec file)
#                              |-- SRPMS
#  <root> is defined by %userhomedir macro
#  usr    is defined by %_prefix rpm macro
#  local, src, redhat are defined in .spec file
#  BUILD, RPMS ... are implicitly define by rpm package
#
# The rpm option "--define 'macroname value'" can be use also to redefine some
#   macro values (see the macros doc file).

# if this file is not existing in $HOME/ or in /etc/rpm directory,
#   or not imported .rpmrc (macrofiles: option definition)
#   the package must be build by root user in file system root : /
#   /usr/local/Rand ....
#   /usr/src/redhat/....

# The build root directory must be chossen such a way that it must be empty
#   before install of the package. The various 'brp-strip' rpm shell
#   scripts which are executed just before building the package files
#   try to strip evry executable files in the build_root directory.
#   see : /usr/lib/rpm/brp-redhat and the other /usr/lib/rpm/brp-* files.

# Use 'rpm --showrc' to see how macros and values are set.

# Where is the root to build packages :
#  in the user home directory
%userhomedir %(echo $HOME)

#  or some where else
# %userhomedir /tmp/perrioll

# the default value of _prefix is defined (/usr) by the rpm macros :
#   /usr/lib/rpm/macros
%userdir %{?userhomedir:%{userhomedir}}%{_prefix}

%_topdir %{userdir}/src/redhat

%buildroot %{userhomedir}/tmp/rpm_buildroot
